Evaluates two operands by passing each element of input set through two different pipelines,
then returns a boolean indicating whether the resulting values are conceptually equal.

The equality is tested according to following rules:

- strings are compared ignoring case, diacritics and extraneous whitespace
- objects are compared key-by-key recursively (deep equality), keys are compared strictly
- arrays are compared element-wise
- all other data types are coerced to strings and compared according the above rules

Inner pipelines should return a single element for each element in input set.

### Use For

- general purpose equality tests
- filtering by matching data from various sources
  (e.g. one of the operands may obtain Job Inputs to test input values against)
