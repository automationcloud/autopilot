Evaluates two operands by passing each element of input set through two different pipelines,
then returns a boolean indicating whether operand A conceptually contains operand B.

The result depends on the data type of operand A and is evaluated according to following rules:

- if operand A is an object, then the result is \`true\` only if operand B is also an object,
  and each value of object B is equal to the corresponding value of object A
- if operand B is an array, then the result is \`true\` only is operand B is also an array,
  and each item of array B exists in array A
- all other data types are coerced to strings, and \`true\` is returned if B is a substring of A

Inner pipelines should return a single element for each element in input set.

### Use For

- general purpose containment tests which work across multiple data types, specifically:
  - is string a substring of another string
  - is object a sub-object of another object
  - is array a sub-array of another array

### See Also

- Contains Text: for simpler alternative when second operand is a string constant
