/**
 * Manages request interception.
 *
 * Most common use cases require request interception to span across all connected targets.
 * Additionally, request interception may be required by multiple unrelated logical parts
 * of the automation.
 *
 * To address these concerns, Automation Engine includes modular request interception APIs
 * with following features:
 *
 * - interception can be enabled either for individual page (via `Page.interceptRequests`),
 *   or for all pages (vai `Browser.interceptRequests`)
 * - multiple interceptors can be stacked together; interception callback allows
 *   passing request further along the interceptors chain (with or without modifications),
 *   as well as handling the request exclusively (e.g. by fulfilling it with custom response,
 *   or aborting it, or sending it with or without modifications bypassing next interceptors)
 * - interceptors can be added and removed dynamically via synchronous APIs to minimize race
 *   conditions
 * - callbacks are executed asynchronously, allowing for custom I/O in handlers
 *
 * ### Details
 *
 * - Each opened target enables request interception from very beginning, sending `Fetch.enable`.
 *   Note that only `Request` stage interception is currently supported
 *   (which means we can't fire request onwards and later modify the response).
 * - Request interceptors are installed via `Browser#interceptRequests` or `Page#interceptRequests`.
 * - Interceptors are processed in the same order as installed, global interceptors always take precedence
 *   over local (Page-specific) ones.
 * - Each interceptor's handler is executed for each request.
 * - Handler may produce an outcome which *immediately* results in one of
 *   `fulfillResponse`, `failRequest` or `continueRequest` commands being sent and
 *   subsequent interceptors *not* invoked.
 * - If handler does not return an outcome, the request is passed onwards to the next interceptor and so forth —
 *   until the end of interceptors chain.
 * - At the end, if no interceptors produced an outcome, the request is resumed unmodified
 *   (as per normal browser behaviour).
 * - Handler can return an outcome by invoking one of the `InterceptedRequest` methods and returning its results.
